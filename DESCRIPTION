Description: This package is used to generate plots based on the IPV concept.
    IPVs are visualizations derived from multiple structure equation models
    (SEMs) of the same item pool. IPVs are used to show the conceptual
    structure of item pools. They show relationships between correlated
    factor models and general factor models as well as relationships between
    correlated factors of the same model.
