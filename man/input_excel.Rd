\title{Input Excel}
\usage{
input_excel(global = NULL, factors)
}
\arguments{
\item{global}{character; name of the excel file containing data on the overall general factor and the factors.}

\item{factors}{character; name(s) of the excel file(s) containing data on the factor(s) and its/their facets.}
}
\value{
list containing formatted data including center distances for use with \code{\link{model_items}}, \code{\link{model_facets}}, and \code{\link{model_nested}}.
}
\description{
This function reads excel files containing factor loadings and latent correlations for IPV plots.
}
\details{
Note that the excel files need a very specific structure. Use the example files below as templates.
The \code{global} argument defaults to NULL.
This allows to read data on a single factor and its facets to the \code{factors} argument.
The result is a more simple model that can be displayed by an item plot and a facet plot.
}
\examples{
# read data for a single factor by ignoring the "global" parameter of input_excel
x <- input_excel(factors = system.file("extdata", "DSSEI.xlsx", package = "IPV", mustWork = TRUE))

# read data for a nested factor model
# note that excel files need to be split as in the example to contain only
# one general factor and one correlated factor model for the same set of items
global <- system.file("extdata", "IPV_global.xlsx", package = "IPV", mustWork = TRUE)
factors <- c(system.file("extdata", "IPV_DSSEI.xlsx", package = "IPV", mustWork = TRUE),
             system.file("extdata", "IPV_SMTQ.xlsx", package = "IPV", mustWork = TRUE),
             system.file("extdata", "IPV_RSES.xlsx", package = "IPV", mustWork = TRUE))
x <- input_excel(global = global,factors = factors)
