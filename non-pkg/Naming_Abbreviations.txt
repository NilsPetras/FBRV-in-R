abbreviations used

	as object names or function parameters:
	coor	=	COORdinates
	cor	=	CORrelation
	pol	=	POLar coordinates of
	cart	=	CARTesian coordinates of
	V1, V2	=	Variable 1, Variable 2
	col	=	COLour
	
	plural "s" is carried over
		e.g.: 	one coordinate		= coor
			several coordinates	= coors
	
	only in the code:
	cplx	=	ComPLeXity, the number of facets of a factor
	nam	=	NAMes, the names of facets
	
	
naming conventions

	functions
		all fbrv function names start with "fbrv."
		words are seperated by dots as in "my.function.name"
		
	variables
		words are seperated by underscores as in "my_variable_name"
		in lists, some variables are stacked to emphasize relationships
		 	e.g. in the input data of one factor is listed under its factor name
	plot parameters
		parameters that are a combination of an attribute and an object refer to a single object
			e.g. "size_title"
		other parameters mostly refer to several elements at once
			e.g. "size", "mycol"


some names explained

	"phi" and "rho" are polar coordinates while "x" and "y" are cartesian coordinates
		reminder: 	"phi" is the angle and "rho" the distance to the origin
				angles are given in values between 0 and 2*pi, e.g. pi = 180°
				polar and cartesian coordinates have the following relationship:
				x = cos(phi)*rho	y = sin(phi)*rho
				
	"x","y" and "rho" coordinates with numbers ("x1", "x2", ...) refer to ends of lines and are named from the center to the periphery if possible
	"x0" and "y0" coordinates refer to line ends in the center of a circle
	
	"global" refers to the overall context while "factor" refers to a single factor context
	"factor" refers to a more general factor while "subfactor" refers to the factors facets
		a "subfactor" of an overall "factor" can itself be a "factor" to its own "subfactor"s, these names are used relative to each other
	the prefix "sub-" refers to something that is nested within something else
		e.g. "rotate" is a parameter to rotate the overall plot while "subrotate" rotates the parts of the plot
	
	"label" refers to a text that is displayed in the graphic as geom_text (ggplot2)
	
	"inner_cors" refers to the correlations between facets of a factor
